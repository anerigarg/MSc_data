# The curves seem to be a non-linear curve Michaelis-Menten curve or a simple asymptotic curve (Crawley p. 661)
# three solutions are possible:
# 1) transform data to linearize curve--> doesnt work, i tried it, except for (height)^10 which is not really elegant
# 2) modeling the whole curve with pre-defined curves (e.g. Crawley 674): too complicated because one needs to find out the starting values
# 3) GAM: too complicated and oversophisticated
# 4) analyzing data before the asymptotic curve when it is still linear: initial growth rate --> best solution because it is clear and crisp
