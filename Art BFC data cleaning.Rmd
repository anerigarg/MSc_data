## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Structural operations to generally view data and see how each variable is classed
 
 
 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
sapply(ArtBFC,class)

test=ArtBFC
#ArtBFC = test

ArtBFC$life_phase = as.factor(ArtBFC$life_phase)

library(dplyr)
ArtBFC = select(ArtBFC,-7)

head(ArtBFC)

```
## Suvey number cleaning
```{r}
test=ArtBFC
#ArtBFC = test

sort(unique(ArtBFC$survey_number))
#232, 235, 238 and 241 should be recruit surveys (all Noelle on July 28th). They are in the recruit data sheet. 244, 247, 250 and 253 are missing from BFC, these are what these data correspond to (Noelle July 28th)
#check data sheet for which survey number corresponds to which plot and change
```

##grid number cleaning
```{r}
sort(unique(ArtBFC$grid_number))

n_distinct(ArtBFC$grid_number)

#looks good, there are 24 distinct levels from 1-24 in sort results
```

##cleaning life phase

```{r}
table(ArtBFC$life_phase)
#need to replace x4 small a and x1 i
#did it in excel- had the exact right number to replace

#check using new data file
table(ArtBFC$life_phase)
```

##cleaning transit
```{r}
table(ArtBFC$transit)

unique(ArtBFC$transit)
#all looks good
```
##cleaning species ID
```{r}
table(ArtBFC$species_ID)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
